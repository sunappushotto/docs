# Create a space

{% hint style="info" %}
If you already have a space without LNS domain (legacy), you need to [Migrate your space to LNS](https://docs.snapshot.page/spaces/migrate).
{% endhint %}

### 1. Get an LNS domain for your space

If you haven't already, follow this guide - [https://docs.snapshot.org/spaces/before-creating-your-space](https://docs.snapshot.org/spaces/before-creating-your-space) to get your LNS domain.&#x20;

### 2a. Set LNS text-record

Now that you have a LNS address you can go back to snapshot and set the space controller inside the LNS text-record. Selecting the plus icon in the sidebar and then select the LNS address you just setup.

![Click the plus button in the sidebar and then click you LNS address you just setup](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png>)

On the next step enter the wallet address that you would like to set as the space controller and click "Set controller".&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
You will need to sign an transaction on the Ethereum Mainnet to set the LNS text-record.
{% endhint %}

After the transaction is confirmed, the page will redirect you to the settings page of your space. You can now skip to Step 3.

### 2b. (optional) Manually set LNS text-record

Once you have created your LNS domain, you can manually set the LNS text-record for your space. The LNS text-record needs to look like the following:

`ipns://storage.snapshot.page/registry/`**`<Controller Address>`**`/`**`<LNS Address>`**

Replace the "Controller Address" and "LNS Address" with your details.

* On the LNS page, click on **ADD/EDIT RECORD**.
* Select **TEXT** and type the key **"snapshot"** in lowercase.
* Paste the **IPNS link** in the field.
* Click **Save**.
* Scroll down and click **Confirm**.
* Sign the transaction with your wallet.

### **3. Setup your space settings**

You should now be on the settings page, if you have trouble finding the settings page you can manually navigate to it with the following URL:&#x20;

`https://snapshot.org/#/`**`<LNS DOMAIN>`**`/settings`

#### Profile

* **Symbol** is the main token symbol that will be displayed in your space.
* **Skin** can be left as a default, used as an existing one or you can [create your own skin](add-skin.md).

![Select a skin](../.gitbook/assets/select-a-skin.png)

* **Twitter** and **Github** just add a username to link to your different accounts.
* **Domain name** is optional but you can [add a custom domain](add-custom-domain.md).
* **Terms** links to your website's terms and conditions.
* **Hide space from homepage** if you want to keep your space "private".

#### **Strategies**

A strategy is a JavaScript function that defines how the voting power is calculated. You need to add a voting strategy for your proposals. erc20-balance-of is the most used strategy.  You can have multiple strategies and can have your custom strategies as well.&#x20;

You need to add a voting strategy for your proposals. `erc20-balance-of` is the most common strategy.

![Add a strategy](../.gitbook/assets/add-a-strategy.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
You can add up to 5 strategies in your space.
{% endhint %}

Once selected, you can edit the strategy by clicking on it if you want to add your own token.

{% endcontent-ref %}

#### Admins

The admins will be able to edit the space settings and moderate proposals. You must add one address per line.

![Add admins' addresses](../.gitbook/assets/add-admins-addresses.png)

#### Filters

* **Proposal threshold** is the minimum number of tokens required to create a proposal.
* **Proposal validation** is a custom function to validate if someone can post a proposal or not. You can use the basic validation by default which takes your voting power with space strategies and checks if you pass a defined threshold.

**Allow only authors to submit a proposal,** authors will be able to create proposals without being constrained by filters. You must add one address per line. Makes sure that only members specified in authors field are allowed to submit a proposal.&#x20;
