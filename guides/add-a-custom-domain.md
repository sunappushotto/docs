    └── domains.json
```

#### Insert it in the domains list

You must then add your domain in the [domains.json file](https://github.com/snapshot-labs/snapshot-spaces/blob/master/spaces/domains.json) by following this example.

```javascript
{
  "my.custom.url": "my-space.eth"
}
```

#### Configure your DNS 

You will need to add this as CNAME in your domain DNS `snapshotpage.b-cdn.net`
